WARNING: Sequences A0A182YU69 and A0A6P7SER3 are exactly identical!
WARNING: Duplicate sequences found: 1

NOTE: Reduced alignment (with duplicates and gap-only sites/taxa removed)

Alignment comprises 1 partitions and 1165 patterns

Partition 0: noname
Model: JTT+G4m
Alignment sites / patterns: 1226 / 1165
Gaps: 84.26 %
Invariant sites: 18.27 %


NOTE: Binary MSA file created: data/pfam/raxml/T1.raxml.rba

Parallelization scheme autoconfig: 1 worker(s) x 8 thread(s)


NOTE: Per-rate scalers were automatically enabled to prevent numerical issues on taxa-rich alignments.
NOTE: You can use --force switch to skip this check and fall back to per-site scalers.
