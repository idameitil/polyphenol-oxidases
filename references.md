# Names
type-3 copper proteins and coupled binuclear cupper (CBC) proteins are not completely the same thing.

Laccases have a type-3 copper binding domain, but also a type-2 (or type 1...) domain

# The non-catalytic domains
- “The latent enzyme can be activated by limited proteolysis with proteinase K which cleaves the polypeptide chain after K382” (Pretzler 2017)
- “Latent and active abPPO4 mushroom tyrosinase cocrystallized with hexatungstotellurate(VI) in a single crystal” (Mauracher 2014)
- “The latent state of tyrosinase (pro-tyrosinase) is composed of the central domain and the C-terminal domain. The latter domain blocks the entrance into the active site by means of a “placeholder” residue which penetrates the active site similarly to the substrate or an inhibitor”, Kanteev, 2015
- “The N-terminal domain is a transit peptide which determines the final location of the enzyme and then undergoes proteolytic removal”
