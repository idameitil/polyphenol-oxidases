# Types of melanin
Here, it is important to differentiate the two main types of fungal melanins: the DOPA-melanin (synthesized from L-tyrosine or L-DOPA) and DHN-melanin (synthesized from dihydroxynaphthalene)

# Abstract
For what it is worth: I asked chatgpt whether it thought there were any important findings in the paper that were not mentioned in the abstract. Here is the answer:

Yes, based on the content of the paper, there are a few important points that were not fully captured in the original abstract. Here are some key aspects that could be emphasized more in the abstract:

1. **Diversity and Phylogenetic Grouping:**
   - The paper conducts a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis, identifying nine distinct groups of PPOs. This finding is central to the paper and could be highlighted more clearly in the abstract, emphasizing the diversity of PPOs across different taxonomic groups.

2. **Structural and Functional Insights:**
   - The study provides detailed insights into the conserved residues within PPO groups, particularly those involved in copper binding, which are critical for enzymatic activity. This structural analysis is important and could be mentioned to underscore how sequence and structure relate to function.

3. **Specificity and Novelty of Short Fungal PPOs:**
   - The identification and characterization of short fungal PPOs, particularly their role in lignin degradation and their activity on ortho-methoxylated phenols, is a novel aspect of the research. The potential implications of these findings for understanding lignin conversion strategies in ascomycetes could be more prominently featured.

4. **Distribution Across Taxa:**
   - The paper discusses the distribution of PPO genes across various taxa, with a focus on the significant variability in gene numbers, particularly the high number of PPO genes in bivalvia and fungi. This variability is a notable observation that provides insight into the evolutionary and functional diversity of PPOs.

5. **Ecological and Industrial Implications:**
   - The potential applications of these findings, particularly in the context of lignin degradation and the broader ecological and industrial implications of PPO activity, could be more explicitly mentioned in the abstract.

6. **Unexplored Functional Diversity:**
   - The paper notes that there are large areas of the phylogenetic tree with no characterized members, particularly in molluscs, cnidarians, oomycetes, and zoopagomycetes. This gap in knowledge and the potential for discovering new PPO activities is an important point that could be highlighted.

7. **Hypotheses on Evolutionary Origins:**
   - The discussion around the evolutionary origins of PPOs, including the possibility of horizontal gene transfer and the debate on whether PPO genes arose in early bacteria or eukaryotes, is an intriguing aspect of the paper that could add depth to the abstract.

By incorporating these points, the abstract would provide a more comprehensive overview of the paper's contributions and emphasize the novel findings and their broader significance.

# O-aminophenol oxidases
o-aminophenol oxidase refers to a diphenolase activity

C-nitrosation and hydroxyanilinase is the same, it puts an O

o-aminophenol oxidase is when it doesn’t put an O

PhD thesis NspF section 1.5.1.6

Noguchi, then Edward Solomon, Ginsbach

NspF was the first to be described to do C-nitrosation

NspF is the only one that does C-nitrosation. It also does o-aminophenol oxidase. Others (tyrosinases) also do o-aminophenol oxidase reaction, but not the C-nitrosation

“Thus enzymes with hydroxyanilinase activity, which currently include NspF and GriF (16, 22), constitute a fourth subclass of the CBC protein family (Fig. 1).”, Ginsbach PNAS

# Caio notes
there are variations in the number of long and short PPOs in the fungal species.
Probably related to life style
Pattern is not clear
Exceptional number of short PPOs are presenet in species
related to growth on living or dead plants
zoopago have their own ppo group. may be involved in their parasit lifestyle with animals, nematodes…
ppo group similar in sequence to short PPOs
tendency is that ascos have more short than long and basidios to have more long than short

# Caio feedback

I got some comments from the reviewers that this reaction is not fundamentally different, in the sense that the catalytic cycle is the same whether the substrate is o-methoxylated or not. (in other words, the proposed cycle always involves the cycling between deoxy-, oxy- and met-states, and that the oxy-state is the one responsible for monooxygenase reaction).

Or maybe the catalytic cycle is in fact different, but more studies are required to elucidate that.

So maybe we need to phrase it in another way, without downsizing the novelty of the reaction.

Although the proposed catalytic cycle for PPO activity on syringyl-type substrates isn't new per se, it is novel that this cycle can occur even when the substrate's ortho-carbon — attacked by oxy-PPO — is protected by a methoxy group. Additionally, it is new that the ortho-methoxy group of such S-type substrates is released as methanol. The novelty lies in the versatility of this conserved catalytic mechanism towards phenols with different aromatic ring structures.

# white and brown rot
white rot: they consume lignin which is brown, so the biomass becomes white. (Phanerochaete carnosa, Trametes cinnabarina, Ganoderma sinense)
Brown rot: they oxidize lignin making it more brown (Gloeophyllum trabeum, Postia placenta)

# PDB sequences
The sequences from the pdbs were downloaded at https://www.rcsb.org/downloads/fasta.

The pdb sequences were cleaned:
- 2Y9X_2 was removed, because it was called "LECTIN-LIKE FOLD PROTEIN". 2Y9W_1 and 2Y9W_2 were removed - they are the same sequence as 2Y9X. Only one is native state and the other is tropolone bound. UPDATED: Both 2Y9X were removed because they are identical to sp|C7FF04|PPO3_AGABI.
- 1WX2_2 was removed, because it was called "MelC".
- 3W6W was removed. The sequence is identical to 3W6Q. 6JU5, 6JU6 etc. were removed. They were almost identical to 3W6Q.
- 4J3P, 4J3Q, 5OR4, 5OR3, 4J3R and 6GSG were identical except for 4J3Q, which is missing the start. Only 4J3P was kept.
- 4OUA and 5M6B: The two chains in 4OUA are identical at the N-terminus, but 4OUA_2 has an additional C-terminal domain. 5M6B is very similar to 4OUA_2. 4OUA_1 was kept.
- 6Z1S is identical to XP_003666010.1, so it was deleted

To be decided:
- 3HHS: according to the paper, this PPO is a heterodimer of 2 homologous polypeptide chains PPO1 and PPO2 (Li, 2009). I guess we should keep both?

# Names
type-3 copper proteins and coupled binuclear cupper (CBC) proteins are not completely the same thing.

Laccases have a type-3 copper binding domain, but also a type-2 and type 1 domain

# The non-catalytic domains
- “The latent enzyme can be activated by limited proteolysis with proteinase K which cleaves the polypeptide chain after K382” (Pretzler 2017)
- “Latent and active abPPO4 mushroom tyrosinase cocrystallized with hexatungstotellurate(VI) in a single crystal” (Mauracher 2014)
- “The latent state of tyrosinase (pro-tyrosinase) is composed of the central domain and the C-terminal domain. The latter domain blocks the entrance into the active site by means of a “placeholder” residue which penetrates the active site similarly to the substrate or an inhibitor”, Kanteev, 2015
- “The N-terminal domain is a transit peptide which determines the final location of the enzyme and then undergoes proteolytic removal”
